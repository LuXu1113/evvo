- Visualising population based on logs
- Configuration
- implement smarted strategies that can be based on fitness improvement, diversity metrics, 
- find a way of parallelizing the tests, especially with async akka nonsense
- Figure out implicits, and see where using them would improve our lives
- use some central controller to keep population size roughly constant
- https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing or similar
- make actor names show up in logs, instead of `temp$aa` or similar
- interactivity - controller that lets you view pareto frontier, run for a fixed amount of time, etc
