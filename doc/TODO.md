### Required for v0 launch:
- network parallelism & island exchange
- more examples
- better docs
- better, configurable logging
- create and provide default agents
- implement smarter strategies, more default strategies, and a better calling API 
- figure out why the examples don't terminate, and fix that


### Longterm 
- visualising population based on logs
- find a way of parallelizing the tests, especially with async akka nonsense
- figure out implicits, and see where using them would improve our lives
- https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing or similar
- interactivity - controller that lets you view pareto frontier, run for a fixed amount of time, etc
- implement way to override configs for evvo and akka
- that can be based on fitness improvement, diversity metrics
