# Evvo by Diatom Labs

Evvo is the Scala framework for [multi-objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization) [evolutionary computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation). The primary design goals are providing the best possible interface for developers, network parallelism, first-class support for any type of problem, and extensible configurations with sane defaults.

Here's an example showing how simple it is to set up and solve a basic problem (on one machine) using Evvo:

```scala
import com.diatom.island._ 
import scala.concurrent.duration._ // for `1.second`

val islandBuilder = EvvoIsland.builder[Solution]()
  .addCreator(createFunc)
  .addMutator(mutateFunc)
  .addDeletor(deleteFunc)
  .addFitness(fitnessFunc1)
  .addFitness(fitnessFunc2)

// create five "islands", run each one for for 1 second
val islandManager = new IslandManager[Solution](5, islandBuilder)
  .run(TerminationCriteria(1.second))

// collects the pareto frontier from each island, and returns the non-dominated set from there 
val paretoFrontierAfter1Second = islandManager.currentParetoFrontier()
```

This will run three asynchronous agents locally: _creators_ create new solutions, _mutators_ copy and modify existing solutions, and _deletors_ remove solutions from the island. Notice how this whole block of code will work on any problem, as long as each of the functions can process that type of data. After spinning for a second, the blocking call to `run(â€¦)` will return. The current [pareto frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency#Use_in_engineering) is then retrieved and bound to `paretoFrontierAfter1Second`. This result will be a diverse set of solutions optimizing for each provided objective. 

This example assumes that you have a defined `Solution` type, a creator function, a mutator function, and a deletor function, as well as two fitness functions. While we can provide a framework for solving evolutionary computing problems in parallel, it is impossible to provide functions that will work for any problem. (There are some exceptions, which you can read more about in _"Built-in Agents"_ and _"Built-in Problem Types"_.) However, writing these functions will be problem-specific, so we leave that to end users and application developers.

#### Terminology
**Actor**: an Akka actor.

**Agent**: _not_ an Akka actor, but an evolutionary process. See _"Asynchronous Evolutionary Computing"_ for further explanation.

**Agent Strategy**: a function that consumes information about the state of the world and tells an agent how often it should be running

**Diversity**: a measure of how similar the solutions in a population are. The exact measure can be customized for each problem, and then computed based on  some metric of solution's distances, or computed based on the scores according to fitness functions, in which case standard measures of distance in Euclidean space can be used.

**Emigration**: an island sending solutions to another island.

**Immigration**: an island receiving new solutions from another island. When this happens, the recipient island may choose to accept none, some, or all of the incoming solutions.

**Island**: the second-largest unit of the evolutionary computing system: a population, shared among multiple actors modifying the population in various ways, and a network component that handles immigration and emigration. 

**Island System** the entire evolutionary computing system: consisting of multiple islands, a manager of those islands, and interactions between the islands.

**Pareto Frontier**: a set of [non-dominated solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency#Pareto_frontier).

#### Asynchronous Evolutionary Computing
As described in [John Rachlin's paper on paper mill optimization](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Goodwin2/publication/245797473_Cooperative_Multiobjective_Decision_Support_for_the_Paper_Industry/links/0046352ca1becd5890000000.pdf), asynchronous multi-agent evolutionary computing systems consist of a common population and multiple "evolutionary agents" that operate on the population. The three basic types of agents are creators, mutators, and deletors: creators make new solutions to add to the population, mutators read some solutions and use them as a basis for new solutions, and deletors read some solutions and decide which should be deleted. These agents, working in parallel, gradually push the overall fitness of a population upwards. (Assuming, of course, that the mutators have a chance of improving fitness, and the deletors remove solutions that tend to be worse than average.) This system is easily parallelizable, as there is only one piece of shared memory - the set of solutions currently in the population. Much of the work (the work of computing new solutions, mutating existing solutions, and deciding which solutions to delete) can be distributed across multiple CPU cores, or even multiple machines.

#### Quickstart
##### Built-in Agents
Likely, the built-in agents will be primarily deletors - deletors can work off the scores a solution gets on the default  
##### Built-in Problem Types
TODO: Implement built-in types (bitstrings, trees, vector of floats, 0-1 knapsack on bitstring, TSP)
